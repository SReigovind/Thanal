# Thanal

## Overview
Thanal is a project focused on virtual Near-Infrared (VNIR) estimation from RGB images of crop leaves. The primary aim is to predict diseases or stress in plants early, utilizing VNIR information without the need for actual NIR equipment.

## Current Status
We have developed a VNIR Estimation model based on U-Net with Attention mechanisms. This model has been trained on a dataset of RGB-NIR paired images specifically for capsicum.

## Demo
A Gradio interface is available for demonstrating the model's capabilities.

## Installation
Instructions for installation will be provided soon.
